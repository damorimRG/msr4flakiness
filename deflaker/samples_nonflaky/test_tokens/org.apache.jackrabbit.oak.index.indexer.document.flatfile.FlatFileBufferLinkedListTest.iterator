 move iter to point at node being removed below
iter1
single entry list must be 1-sized
2 entries in list must be 1-sized after removal of an iterm
iter2
2 entries in list must be 2-sized
2 entries in list must be 1-sized after consuming an item
2 entries in list must be 2-sized even if some other iterator consumed an item
assertEquals
list
remove
 move iter beyond node being removed - this should remain valid
Iterator state once removed from list can't be traversed
fail
iterator
Iterators
size
TEST_NODE_STATE_ENTRY
single entry list must be 1-sized on separate iterators
2 entries in list must be 2-sized on separate iterators
empty list must be 0-sized
 this should work
