 Sample URLs that the CSS URL rewriter does not authorize... make sure we still don't:
LESS_INPUT_NAME
Invalid URI is not present in content
 With the two combined... the content will now be good, but not the authorization
 Run the CSS rewriter with a proxy
isUriAllowed
LESS_OUTPUT_NAME
 So we run the authorization processor to fix that
assertTrue

Invalid URI is not authorized

 With just the CSS URL rewriter
