 Issue-96: some types were not serializable
mapper
Jackson
toList
StreamSupport
registerSubtypes
ensureConfigSerializable
load
stream
toArray
getSubtypeResolver
json
map
isNotNull
Collectors
readValue
spliterator
cfg
 and as an added bonus, let's see we can also read it back:
assertThat
newObjectMapper
ServiceLoader
dummyArray
collect
writeValueAsString
