            Check precedence - Order of precedence - 0 is the lowest.   Parameters in files of
            lower precedence will be overridden by redefinitions in higher precedence files.

            0 - All files in defaultdir/*.xml (sorted by lexical name)
               Files with names lexically lower have lesser precedence than the following ones.
            1 - default.xml
            2 - All files in actiondir/*.xml (sort by lexical name)
               Files with names lexically lower have lesser precedence than the following ones
            3 - action.xml
