     * If we inline this into the assertThat call below, javac resolves it to assertThat(SortedSet),
     * which isn't available publicly. Our @GoogleInternal checks consider that to be an error, even
     * though the code will compile fine externally by resolving to assertThat(Iterable) instead. So
     * we avoid that by assigning to a non-SortedSet type here.
