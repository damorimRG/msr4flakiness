     * ChRootedFs as its uri like file:///chrootRoot.
     * This is questionable since path.makequalified(uri, path) ignores
     * the pathPart of a uri. So our notion of chrooted URI is questionable.
     * But if we were to fix Path#makeQualified() then  the next test should
     *  have been:

    Assert.assertEquals(
        new Path(chrootedTo + "/foo/bar").makeQualified(
            FsConstants.LOCAL_FS_URI, null),
        fSys.makeQualified(new Path( "/foo/bar")));
