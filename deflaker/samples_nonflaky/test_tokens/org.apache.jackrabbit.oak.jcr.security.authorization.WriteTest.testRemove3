         expected result:
         - missing remove permission at path since REMOVE_CHILD_NODES present
           at path only applies for nodes below. REMOVE_CHILD_NODES must
           be present at the parent instead (which isn't)
         - remove permission is however granted at childNPath.
         - privileges: both at path and at childNPath 'remove_node' and
           'remove_child_nodes' are present.
