fn:upper-case(jcr:content/n/@foo)
 Create nodes that will be served by the index definition that follows
select * from [nt:base] order by upper([jcr:content/n/foo]) DESC
test

    Given an index def with 2 orderable property definitions(Relative) for same property - one with function and one without
    Order by should give correct results
