   * Assume that this test won't usually be run on a Windows box.
   * This test case allows testing of the correct syntax of the Windows
   * commands, even though they don't actually get executed on a non-Win box.
   * The basic idea is to have enough here that substantive changes will
   * fail and the author will fix and add to this test as appropriate.
   * 
   * Depends on the HardLinkCGWin class and member fields being accessible
   * from this test method.
