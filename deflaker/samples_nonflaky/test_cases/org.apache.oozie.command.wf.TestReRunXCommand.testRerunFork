/**
 * This tests a specific edge case where rerun can fail when there's a fork, the actions in the fork succeed, but an action
 * after the fork fails.  Previously, the rerun would step through the forked actions in the order they were listed in the
 * fork action's XML; if they happened to finish in a different order, this would cause an error during rerun.  This is fixed by
 * using the new execution path for LiteWorkflowInstance#signal, which this test verifies.
