/**
 * This test is a workaround for the Jacoco limitations. A call to {@link System#exit(int)}
 * will never return, so Jacoco coverage probe will be missing. By mocking the {@code System}
 * class we turn {@code System.exit()} to noop and the Jacoco coverage probe should succeed.
 *
 * @throws Exception if error occurs
 * @see <a href="https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/issues/117">Jacoco issue 117</a>
