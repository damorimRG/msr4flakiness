/**
 * The {@code SegmentWriter} should be able to write blob IDs whose length

 * BlobStore} to obtain information about the blob.
 * <p/>
 * This code path executes only if the written stream is {@code
 * Segment.MEDIUM_LIMIT} bytes long (or more). If the length of the stream
 * is smaller, the binary value is inlined in the segment and the {@code
 * BlobStore} is never called.
