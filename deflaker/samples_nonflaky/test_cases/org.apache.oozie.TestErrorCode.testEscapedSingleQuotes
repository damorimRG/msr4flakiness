// MessageFormat requires that single quotes are escaped by another single quote; otherwise, it (a) doesn't render the single
// quote and (b) doesn't parse the {#} tokens after the single quote.  For example, foo("{0} don't have {1}", "I", "a problem")
// would render as "I dont have {1}".  This test checks that we don't accidently do this.  It should be
// foo("{0} don''t have {1}", "I", "a problem"), which would result in "I dont have a problem".
