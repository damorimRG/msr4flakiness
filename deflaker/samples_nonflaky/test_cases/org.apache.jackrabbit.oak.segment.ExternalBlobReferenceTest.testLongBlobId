/**
 * If the {@code BlobStore} returns a blob ID whose length is {@code
 * Segment.BLOB_ID_SMALL_LIMIT} bytes long (or more), writing the stream
 * should succeed. In this case, the blob ID is considered a long blob ID
 * and an alternate encoding is used. It should be possible to correctly
 * read the blob ID back and pass it to the {@code BlobStore} to obtain
 * information about the blob.
 * <p/>
 * This code path executes only if the written stream is {@code
 * Segment.MEDIUM_LIMIT} bytes long (or more). If the length of the stream
 * is smaller, the binary value is inlined in the segment and the {@code
 * BlobStore} is never called.
 * <p/>
 * See OAK-3105 and OAK-3107.
