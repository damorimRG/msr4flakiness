/**
 * Test race conditions between clone() and getProps().
 * Test for race conditions in the way Hadoop handles the Configuration
 * class. The scenario is the following. Let's assume that there are two
 * threads sharing the same Configuration class. One adds some resources
 * to the configuration, while the other one clones it. Resources are
 * loaded lazily in a deferred call to loadResources(). If the cloning
 * happens after adding the resources but before parsing them, some temporary
 * resources like input stream pointers are cloned. Eventually both copies
 * will load the same input stream resources.
 * One parses the input stream XML and closes it updating it's own copy of
 * the resource. The other one has another pointer to the same input stream.
 * When it tries to load it, it will crash with a stream closed exception.
