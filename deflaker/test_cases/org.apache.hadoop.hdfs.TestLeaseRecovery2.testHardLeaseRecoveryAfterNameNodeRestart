/**
 * This test makes it so the client does not renew its lease and also
 * set the hard lease expiration period to be short, thus triggering
 * lease expiration to happen while the client is still alive. The test
 * also causes the NN to restart after lease recovery has begun, but before
 * the DNs have completed the blocks. This test verifies that when the NN
 * comes back up, the client no longer holds the lease.
 *
 * The test makes sure that the lease recovery completes and the client
 * fails if it continues to write to the file, even after NN restart.
