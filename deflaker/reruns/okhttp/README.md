Configurations I needed to make to run script "s" within project's directory:

1. install kotlin

 $> sudo snap install --classic kotlin

2. install Java jdk/jre 9

 see: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html

3. upgrade gradle

 see: https://askubuntu.com/questions/932083/how-do-i-upgrade-gradle

 The sdkman alternative worked out fine to me.
